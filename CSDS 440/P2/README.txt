Progress for this week:
	-runnable naive bayes.
		- make_bins
		- discretize continuous
		- calculate probabilties of label and attributes
		- evaluation on testing Set
		- calcualte AUC
		- calculate std
	- runnable logistic regression
		- standardize nominal and continuous attributes
		- normalize all attributes
		- calculate probability of label and attributes
		- evaluation on testing Set
		- calcualte AUC
		- calculate std

**nbayesNB and logregNB are two original files for the assignment. nbayesR file is the research of Naive Bayes. logregR1 and logregR2 are two files for research part I and part ii of logistic regression
