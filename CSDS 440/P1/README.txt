Summary of progress:
	Complete:
	- extract attribute type and value, and examples
	- information gain and gain ratio calculation
	- entropy for label and attribute
	- find continuous lines and values
	- decision Trees
	- evaluate tree
	- make folds and cross validations
	- standard output format
	- debugging for syntax and math calculation
	- research on iterative deepening, binary tree, simplification of entropy calculation
	- fix bugs, finalized original decision tree


Feedback on the API and documentation:
	Hope to have more helpful comments and examples about the functions and classes.
