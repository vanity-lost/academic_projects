All the classifiers are modified for adaptive boosting. To run the program, the format of the input is python boost.py /folder/filename 0/1 algorithm_name iteration_number. 0/1 indicating full sample or cross validation. Algorithm name will be 'dtree', 'nabyes', 'logreg'. 

boost.py  --- main boosting file
logreg.py   --- logreg classifier with original AdaBoost
nbayes.py   --- nbayes classifier with original AdaBoost
dtree.py    --- dtree classifier with original AdaBoost
Data Visualization.ipynb  --- Jupyter notebook part of the assignment
logregNB.py --- logreg classifier modified to draw the graph for part b of the assignment and research
logregR1.py --- logreg classifier with research part 1.2
logregR4.py --- logreg classifier with research part 2
logregR7.py --- logreg classifier with research part 3

All explanations of the research part are recorded in the Jupyter notebook, there will be no further explanation provided here.
